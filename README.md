# WeWorld - The app that pays you to be more eco-friendly
**Welcome to WeWorld**

<h1>What are we combating?</h1>
14 billion pounds of rubbish are dumped in the ocean every year.
Global Warming/ Climate change.

**Why is this important?**

Recycling alone prevents 85 million tons of waste from being dumped per year.
Inundating coastlines, intensifying droughts and increased poverty.

<h1>Why should you care?</h1>

By 2030, it will be too late to reverse the disaster.
This will ruin the lives of generations and may cause human life to become extinct.

<h1>Our Solution?</h1>

A globally accessible app which incentivises eco-friendly lifestyles to billions instantly.
With numerous monetary, competitive, and game incentives, we hope to assist everyone in reducing their ecological footprint in a fun and gratifying way. We provide a gamified, material-free solution for establishing a greener habit that is generally accessible to anyone with a smartphone. Join us as we become the first company to openly sell sustainability to the broader public.
A material-free solution that tackles multiple environmental problems at once.

<h1>Why are we different?</h1>

No one has been able to market sustainability to the general population before, this will be the first of it's kind.

<h1>How does it work?</h1>

For making environmentally conscientious selections and learning about sustainability, the user will be rewarded. They can then begin to create their own virtual world by purchasing property, growing trees, and caring for them. Trees will produce in-game currency in a passive manner, incentivizing the user to plant more trees and earn more money. It will be possible to buy real-world and in-game things at a reduced price with this in-game currency.

WeWorld will securely link to apps such as pedometers, food tracking and bank account apps, enriching financial data with ecological information.
The application will automatically identify and measure the environmental impact of everything you buy and will reward you with $eed tokens when you reduce your footprint.Recommendations are given to users on how to change their habits towards a greener lifestyle.
Examples of this include walking or using public transport/carpooling, switching to a greener energy provider, buying greener brands and also turning vegan/vegetarian.

<h1>Roadmap</h1>

We wish to increase awareness about the issue and track the progress we've made, such as lowering the Global Warming Index to zero (and reducing the trash sent to landfills). We want to turn the virtual world into a metaverse where people may build houses, buy animals, and visit, communicate, and compete with one another. WeWorld also intends to collaborate with organisations such as the World Wildlife Fund so that you can adopt in-game animals such as pandas in real life.


**Now that you know what WeWorld is, you can help us save the real world, by creating your own WeWorld.**
